I used to have a blog. Two, actually.
I should start blogging again, so this is the beginning of that.

As for me: I'm a programmer, a dad, a husband, a son and a brother.
I'm also a lot of other things, but then again, so are you, and you
probably don't want to make a huge list.

I am Italian (Cerveteri, Rome), but based in Budapest (Hungary), and if you're around and want to
grab the drink of your choice, just ping me and I'll be happy to join you.
