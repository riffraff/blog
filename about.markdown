Hello there!

I'm Gabriele, welcome to this space. I used to have a blog. Two, actually.
I should start blogging again, so this is the beginning of that, and at least an attempt
to revive some of the pages it once had.

As for me: I'm a programmer, a dad, a husband, a son and a brother.
I'm also a lot of other things, but then again, so are you, and you
probably don't want to make a huge list.

I am Italian (Cerveteri, Rome), but based in Budapest (Hungary), and if you're around and want to
grab the drink or food of your choice, ping me and I'll be happy to join you.
